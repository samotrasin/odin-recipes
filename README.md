i have learned some HTML and CSS before, and currently I am learning JavaScripts. 
The Odin Project helps me fill in the gaps that I have missed about HTML. Morever, The Odin Project taught me about how to use Git, which I have also learned, but I did not understand much about GIT.
As for now, I am building a very basic website from what The Odin Project has taught me so far.
